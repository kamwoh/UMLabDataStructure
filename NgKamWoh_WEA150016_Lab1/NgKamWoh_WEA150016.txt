My name is Ng Kam Woh with matrix number, WEA150016. I am majoring in Artificial Intelligence. 
This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject.
This is because I feel Data Structure is challenging.

I will be hardworking to study.
